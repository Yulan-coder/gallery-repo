# Engineering Practices Demo

Welcome to the GitHub Copilot engineering practices demo! Here we're going to get comfortable with the professional tools and features in GitHub Copilot. We'll start in the VS Code IDE and then move to github.com for additional collaboration features.

## What You'll Learn
By the end of this demo, you will:
- [ ] Understand how to debug and inspect Copilot's decision-making process
- [ ] Know how to share chat conversations with team members
- [ ] Be familiar with system prompts and their importance
- [ ] Understand collaboration features on GitHub.com

**Estimated Time:** 10-15 minutes

## üîß IDE Features for Engineering Teams

GitHub Copilot has many features designed to help engineering teams understand AI decision-making and collaborate effectively on code generation.

### üêõ Step 1: Inspect Copilot's Decision Process

**Why this matters:** Understanding how Copilot makes suggestions helps you write better prompts and trust the AI's recommendations.

#### Method 1: Using Keyboard Shortcut
1. Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + Shift + P` (Mac)
2. Type "Copilot Chat Debug" 
3. Select **"Copilot Chat Debug: Focus on Copilot Chat Debug View"**

#### Method 2: Using the Menu
1. Go to **View** ‚Üí **Command Palette**
2. Type "Copilot Chat Debug"
3. Select **"Copilot Chat Debug: Focus on Copilot Chat Debug View"**

#### What You'll See
Once the debug panel opens, you can explore:
- **Prompts:** The actual prompts sent to the AI
- **System Prompts:** Background instructions given to Copilot
- **Metadata:** Context information and settings
- **Response Details:** How Copilot formulated its suggestions

**üí° Pro Tip:** Use this when Copilot's suggestions seem unexpected - you can see exactly what context it's using!
