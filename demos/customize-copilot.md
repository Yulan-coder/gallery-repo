## üîÑ Step 2: Advanced Model Switching (OPTIONAL)

Mode: edit

For this demo, try the same coding task with different models and note the differences.

### Instructions:

1. update your mode to **edit**
2. select the model you want to try out
3. add in the following files:
  - /src/app/gallery/page.tsx
  - /src/lib/mock-photo-data.ts
  - /src/components/GalleryGrid.tsx
4. Stay on the last page: GalleryGrid and highlight lines 26 - 43
5. add in below prompt:

Prompt
```typescript
// Ask each model: "Help me refactor this function for better performance, readability, and add TypeScript improvements"
```

Repeat steps 2-5 for two other models of your choosing.

Which answers did you like the best? which the least? Discuss in your group.

## üìù Step 3: Use Prompt Files

1. Go to the prompts folder and look through the files. 
  - There are three files to choose from each in varying difficult levels. 
  - Look over the format of each before choosing which one.
2. Choose the file you want to test out
3. Add in the prompt below depending on the prompt file.

**Generate mock data**
Prompt
```
/generate-mock-photo-data 3
```

**Generate new UI component**
Prompt
```
/generate-new-ui for the recent galleries table in the admin page. I want it to be the replacement component for the current table. Place it in the layout folder.
```

**Generate new gallery feature**
Prompt
```

```
