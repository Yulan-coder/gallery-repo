## Code Style Guidelines
- Use TypeScript strict mode
- Implement proper error handling for file operations
- Follow Next.js 15 App Router patterns
- Use server components where appropriate
- Implement proper image optimization techniques
- Create reusable UI components
- Use proper semantic HTML for accessibility

## Features to Implement
1. Drag & drop image upload interface
2. Automatic image resizing and format optimization
3. Tagging and categorization system
4. Gallery organization with albums/collections
5. Public portfolio sharing with custom URLs
6. Client proofing interface with approval/rejection
